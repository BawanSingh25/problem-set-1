It does this by first creating a list L from 2 to n and an (initially empty) list primeL. The algorithm then takes the first number in list L (2) and appends it to list primeL, and then removes 2 and all its multiples (4,6,8,10,12, ...) from L. The algorithm then takes the new first number in L (3) and appends it to list primeL, and then removes from L 3 and all its remaining multiples (9,15,21,...). So, in every iteration, the first number of list L is appended to list primeL and then it and its multiples are removed from list L. The iterations stop when list L becomes empty. Write a function sieve() that takes as input a positive integer n, implements the above algorithm, and returns a list of all prime numbers up to n. \n",
